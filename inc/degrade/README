Description:
------------
This package degrades JPEG images on the fly to a given resolution to decrease
the size of the resulting PostScript or PDF file.

Requirements:
-------------
You'll need the convert utility from the ImageMagick bundle and the jpeg2ps
program from CTAN if you don't use VTeX. Because of the script "degrade.sh"
this package works only on Unix-like systems.

Installation:
-------------
Put the script "degrade.sh" in your $PATH and make it executable.
Put "degrade.sty" in a place where TeX can find it.

Commands:
---------
\DegSetup{key=value,...}
Known keys are:
* res to set the resolution in dpi (default=100, example: res=300)
* dir to set the directory where to put the resized jpeg files
  (default=degrade)
* sdir to set the directory where images should be found in general
  (default: current directory)

\degimage[w|h]{width or height}{image}
Use this instead of \includegraphics to include your image.
example 1: \degimage{\linewidth}{flower},
example 2: \degimage[h]{0.5\textheight}{power}
